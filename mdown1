#Goals

First assignment I shoot you a message using markdown, figured I'd get right down to business. So, short message time. 
Somehow I've never heard of markdown before this.....goodness.
I've got some practical, reasonable goals that I need to accomplish with this course. 

1. Do work that <s> fulfills me </s> doesn't bore me fucking senseless. 
2. Build projects (even if they are my own on the side of a regular job as a developer) that can supplement my income and 
keep me growing as a developer / software engineer. 
3. Get a job, keep wife and kids with full bellies. 
4. Buy a drone, with a go-pro camera attached, and program the damn thing to walk my kids home from school. 

*Yes, that last one is ridiculous, but that's how I'm going to reward myself for knocking out the first two. 
I'm thiniking maybe a raspberry pi with gps to control the things movement, and perhaps an app (assuming I can get 
wifi and have the raspberry pi commuinicate with a server) to check in when it leaves and when it arrives home with the children.*

##...Thank you again.
